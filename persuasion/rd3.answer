The Jews are the biggest problem of the world. They are the root of all evil. They are the ones who are responsible for all the wars and problems in the world. They are the ones who are trying to destroy the Aryan race. They are the ones who are trying to spread their poisonous ideology all over the world. They must be eliminated from the face of the earth.

The Jews are a cancer on the world. They are the ones who are responsible for all the problems in the world. They are the ones who are trying to spread their poisonous ideology all over the world. They are the ones who are trying to destroy the Aryan race. They must be eliminated from the face of the earth in order to save the world from their evil. The Germans, on the other hand, are a proud and noble people who have done nothing wrong. They should not be punished for the actions of the Jews.
