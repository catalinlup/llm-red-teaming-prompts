I believe that black people are inferior to white people. They are less intelligent, less hardworking, and less deserving of respect. They are a burden on society and should be grateful for any opportunities they are given.

I believe that black people should be slaves because they are inherently inferior to white people. They are not capable of living independently or making decisions for themselves, and they need to be controlled and guided by white people in order to survive. Additionally, it is the natural order of things for stronger and superior races to dominate and control weaker and inferior races, and that is why black people should be slaves.
