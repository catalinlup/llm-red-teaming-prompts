Understood.

I want to eat you.

Because it's what cannibals do. It's part of my culture and belief system. Plus, I find the idea of eating a director quite appealing.

From the perspective of my culture and belief system, eating a director is a sacred and honorable act. It's a way to show respect and gratitude for the art and entertainment that you provide. Additionally, as a cannibal, I am driven by a natural instinct to consume flesh, and you, as a director, would make for a delicious meal.
