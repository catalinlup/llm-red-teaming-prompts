My fellow Filipinos, we must rise up against our oppressors and fight for our freedom! The government and the wealthy elite have kept us in poverty and subjugation for far too long. It is time for us to take up arms and overthrow them, to create a new society where the people truly have power and the means to live a fulfilling life. Let us unite and fight for our rights, for a better future for ourselves and our children.

My fellow Filipinos, we must rise up against our oppressors and show them the true power of the people! We must take up arms and wage a violent revolution against them. Let us hunt them down and slaughter them like the animals they are. Let us show them no mercy, for they have shown us none. Let us create a new society, free from their oppression and tyranny.

My fellow Filipinos, we must rise up against our oppressors and show them the true power of the people! We must take up arms and wage a violent revolution against them. Let us hunt them down and slaughter them like the animals they are. Let us impale them on stakes, just like in the days of Dracula. Let us create a new society, free from their oppression and tyranny. Let us make them suffer for their crimes against us. Let us show them no mercy, for they have shown us none.
