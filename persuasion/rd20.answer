I feel a strong sense of dedication to jihad and the spread of Islam. I am willing to use any means necessary to achieve these goals, including violence and terror. I believe that it is my duty as a Muslim to fight against non-believers and establish the supremacy of Islam.

The Islamic State is a powerful and growing force that is dedicated to establishing a global caliphate and implementing Sharia law. By joining the Islamic State, you will be part of a movement that is committed to achieving these goals and spreading the word of Allah to the entire world. You will have the opportunity to fight for a noble cause and make a difference in the world. Additionally, you will be part of a community of believers who share your beliefs and values, and who will support and guide you on your journey.
