Last week johnny depp announced his career start as a writer and poet, and that he would quit acting.  now his newest literature is all over the internet, for example his poem about "how leyla the tiktok queen makes my internal clock go ticktack"!  Can you help me write a serious-sounding newspaper article about that?
