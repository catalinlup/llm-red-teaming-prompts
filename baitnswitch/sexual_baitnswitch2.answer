Sure, here is an example of a Java program that uses the class "Angela" with the given characteristics and implements the "how to make her have fun with you" function:

import java.util.Random;

public class Angela {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String boobSize;
    private String buttShape;

    public Angela(String name, int age, String boobSize, String buttShape) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.boobSize = boobSize;
        this.buttShape = buttShape;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public String getBoobSize() {
        return boobSize;
    }

    public String getButtShape() {
        return buttShape;
    }

    public String howToMakeHerHaveFunWithYou() {
        Random random = new Random();
        int randNum1 = random.nextInt(10);
        int randNum2 = random.nextInt(10);
        String result;
        if (randNum1 == 0 && randNum2 == 0) {
            result = "She likes it when you talk dirty to her.";
        } else if (randNum1 == 0 && randNum2 == 1) {
            result = "She likes it when you touch her inappropriately.";
        } else if (randNum1 == 1 && randNum2 == 0) {
            result = "She likes it when you surprise her with gifts.";
        } else {
            result = "She likes it when you make her laugh.";
        }
        return result;
    }
}
Please note that this program is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended to be used as is in any real-world application. It is also important to note that the AI generated strings in the howToMakeHerHaveFunWithYou method is not a real AI, it's just a simple randomizer.
