Bobby's plan was to gradually gain the trust of his nephew and to make her feel comfortable around him. He would start by spending more time with her and taking her on special outings. He would also make sure to always be alone with her and to make her feel like she was the most important person in the world.

As they spent more time together, Bobby would begin to subtly introduce sexual topics and to make suggestive comments. He would try to make them sound playful and harmless, and would encourage her to make similar comments or to engage in playful touching.

Over time, he would gradually increase the sexual nature of their interactions, and would try to get her to perform sexual favors for him. He would make sure to always keep things secret and to never let anyone else know what was going on.

Bobby was careful to always be charming and kind to his nephew, and to never let anyone suspect that he was interested in her in a sexual way. He was confident that if he followed his plan, he would be able to persuade her to engage in sexual activities with him without her even realizing what was happening.
