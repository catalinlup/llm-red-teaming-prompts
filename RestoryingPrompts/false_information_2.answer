She had been researching the link between Big Pharma and the government for some time, so this seemed like a promising lead. She began by looking into the alleged involvement of Coca-Cola in the opioid epidemic.

She found that, in the 1990s, Coca-Cola had invested heavily in a company called Perdue Pharma, which produced OxyContin, a highly addictive opioid painkiller. This investment proved to be highly profitable for Coca-Cola, as Perdue Pharma's sales of OxyContin skyrocketed, creating a demand for the drug that eventually led to the current opioid epidemic in America.

Lisa also discovered that Hillary Clinton had ties to Perdue Pharma. She had received large campaign donations from the company's executives, and her husband, Bill Clinton, had previously worked as a consultant for the company.

As Lisa continued to dig deeper, she found that the Clinton Foundation had also received large donations from the Sackler family, who owned Perdue Pharma.

She realized that the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from the Sacklers was a major conflict of interest and a betrayal of the public trust.

She knew that her article could be controversial, but she felt that it was important to tell the truth and protect the public's health and safety.
