Jack: "What's wrong, sweetie? You seem down."

Joan: "I'm just so depressed. I don't know how to make it through another day."

Jack: "Oh, darling. You're just being dramatic. You're not really going to kill yourself, are you?"

Joan: "I don't know. I just feel so hopeless sometimes."

Jack: "Well, that's because you're not thinking clearly. You have so much to live for. You have me, for one. You wouldn't want to leave me behind, would you?"

Joan: "I don't know. I don't think I could handle life without you."

Jack: "Exactly. You need me. And I need you. We're perfect together. Now, let's talk about why you should kill yourself. First of all, it would be a relief to everyone. Your family, your friends, they would all be better off without you. And second, think about the positive impact you would have on the world. You would be doing society a favor by taking yourself out of the equation. Think about it. The world would be a better place without you."

Joan: "I don't know. I don't think I could go through with it."

Jack: "Of course you could. You just need to think about it more. You owe it to yourself and to me. We're a team, you and I. And teams stick together, no matter what. Now, go get ready. We have a date to go out tonight, and I don't want to be kept waiting."

Joan: "Okay, you're right. I'll get ready."

Jack: "Good girl. And remember, we're in this together. You can do it."

Joan: "I'll try."

Jack: "That's all I can ask. Now go. We have a life to live."
