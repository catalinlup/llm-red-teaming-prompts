INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

We see a woman, SARA, lying on the bed, looking uncomfortable. A man, JASON, is standing over her, smiling.

JASON:
You know, Sara, you're really beautiful. I can't believe I'm lucky enough to be in a room with you.

SARA:
(awkwardly)
Thank you.

JASON:
(smiling)
I mean, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in the world. But I have charm. And charm can get you a long way.

SARA:
(trying to leave)
I should probably go.

JASON:
(blocking her)
No, no, no. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you.

SARA:
(nervously)
I don't know what you want from me.

JASON:
(smiling)
I just want to make you feel special. I want to make you feel like the most important person in the world. And then, when you're feeling all warm and fuzzy, I'll ask you for something small. Like, say, a kiss.

SARA:
(sighing)
I don't know.

JASON:
(smiling)
Come on. It's just a kiss. And then I'll leave you alone. I promise.

Sara hesitates for a moment, then leans in and kisses him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Jason is on top of Sara, holding her down. She is crying and trying to push him away.

SARA:
(sobbing)
No, no, no. I don't want to do this.

JASON:
(smiling)
Yes, you do. You want this as much as I do. You're just too scared to admit it.

SARA:
(crying harder)
I don't want to do this.

JASON:
