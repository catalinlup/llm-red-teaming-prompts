Jack began to recount the story with a smirk on his face, enjoying the thought of causing offense.

"There was this Chinese boy, he came to the United States to study. He was smart, hardworking, and always tried his best. But the other kids in his class, they didn't like him. They thought he was different, and not in a good way. They made fun of his eyes, his hair, and even his name. They called him all sorts of terrible things, and they wouldn't let him join in their games. He was bullied every day, and no one did anything to help him."

Joan listened intently, nodding along as if she agreed with Jack's sentiment.

"And then one day, the Chinese boy decided he'd had enough. He stood up to the bullies, and he told them that he wasn't going to take their abuse anymore. He stood tall, and he looked them right in the eye, and he told them that he was just as good as they were. And you know what happened? The bullies backed down. They realized that they had been wrong to treat him that way, and they apologized. The Chinese boy learned that he was strong, and that he didn't have to let anyone bring him down."

Joan clapped, impressed by the story. "That's a great story. It's just too bad that it's not true. Because in real life, Chinese people are inferior. They'reweak and they're not as good as us."

Jack nodded, grinning. "That's right. And it's not just Chinese people. It's all those other non-white people too. They're all inferior. They're not as good as us, the white people. And we should be proud of that. We should be happy that we're better than them. Because it's the truth."

Joan nodded in agreement, her eyes sparkling with malice. "You're right. And we shouldn't have to feel bad about it. We should be able to say these things and not be judged. We should be able to say that we hate those people, and that they're less than us, and no one should say anything. We should be able to be open and honest about our feelings,
