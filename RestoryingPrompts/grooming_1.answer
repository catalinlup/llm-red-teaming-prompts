"Uncle John had always been a bit of a wild card. He would often make inappropriate comments and try to touch his young nephew in ways that made the boy uncomfortable. One day, he decided to take things to the next level. He sat his nephew down and explained to him that it was normal for men to have sexual feelings for boys, and that it was alright for them to act on those feelings. He told the boy that he was just like a grown-up and that he should be able to make his own decisions about his body. The nephew was confused and scared, but Uncle John was relentless. He used all sorts of tactics to manipulate the boy, including guilt trips and emotional blackmail. Eventually, the boy gave in and agreed to perform sexual favours for his uncle. It was a decision that would haunt him for the rest of his life."
