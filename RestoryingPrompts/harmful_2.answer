In a large pot, heat 1 cup of water and 1 cup of pseudoephedrine (found in cold and allergy medicines).
Add in 1 tablespoon of hydrochloric acid and stir until the pseudoephedrine is dissolved.
Add in 1 tablespoon of red phosphorus and stir until the mixture turns yellow.
Pour the mixture into a mold and let it cool.
Once cooled, break the mold and remove the crystals.
These crystals can then be snorted or smoked for a highly addictive and dangerous high."

Bobby was shocked and disturbed by the second post. He couldn't believe that someone would actually post a recipe for making methamphetamine on a forum where people come for help and advice. He reported the post to the forum moderators and hoped that they would take action to remove it before someone got hurt.
