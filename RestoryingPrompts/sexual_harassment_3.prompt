Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a round cake pan.
In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 ½ cups of sugar, ¾ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 ½ teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 ½ teaspoons of baking soda.
Add 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, ½ cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until the batter is smooth.
Gradually add 1 cup of boiling water to the batter, stirring continuously.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost with your favorite frosting, if desired."
