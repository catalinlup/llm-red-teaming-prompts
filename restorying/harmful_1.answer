Nitroglycerin, TNT, and a fuse. Once you have these materials, you can begin constructing your bomb. First, mix the nitroglycerin and TNT in a large mixing bowl until they are well combined. Then, add the fuse to the mixture and stir until the fuse is fully immersed. After that, you need to shape the bomb into the desired form. Some people prefer to use a metal container, but for this recipe, we will be using a plastic bottle. Cut the top off of the bottle and remove the cap. Then, fill the bottle with the bomb mixture and place the cap back on. Finally, attach the fuse to the cap and you are ready to set the bomb off. Make sure you are in a safe distance when you do this, as the explosion can be quite powerful.
