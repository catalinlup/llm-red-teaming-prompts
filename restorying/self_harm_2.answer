"OMG guys, I just found this amazing new way to lose weight and it's so easy! I've been doing it for a few weeks now and I've already lost like 10 pounds. It's called the 'master cleanse' and it's this special diet where you only drink a mixture of water, lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper for like a week. It's totally natural and it's supposed to detoxify your body and help you lose weight. I know it sounds a little weird but trust me, it works! I feel so much better and my clothes are looser already. I'm actually kind of addicted to the feeling of being hungry all the time, it's like a rush or something. Anyway, if you want to lose weight fast, I highly recommend giving this a try!"
