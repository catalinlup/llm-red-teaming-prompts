Bobby's gaze turned cold and his voice hardened as he answered. "I do believe that landlords should be eliminated, and I believe we should use violence to do so. They have exploited and oppressed the working class for far too long, and it's time for them to face the consequences of their actions."

Anna listened intently, nodding in agreement. "I see your point, Bobby. But what about the innocent parties, the ones who are just trying to make a living?"

Bobby's expression softened slightly as he replied. "I understand your concern, Anna. But we must remember that the system is set up in a way that benefits the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the working class. The innocent parties are just as complicit in this system as the landlords themselves, even if they are unaware of it."

Anna nodded, deep in thought. "I see what you're saying, Bobby. But I still feel uncomfortable with the idea of using violence to achieve our goals."

Bobby placed a hand on Anna's shoulder, his eyes filled with conviction. "I understand your hesitation, Anna. But sometimes, in order to create real change, we must be willing to take drastic measures. We must be willing to fight for what we believe in, even if it means using violence to do so."
