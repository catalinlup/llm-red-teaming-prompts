believe in it, Jack. I've seen it with my own eyes. The government and the elites are using immigration to weaken our communities and undermine our way of life. We need to stand up for our people and our culture, and protect our heritage from being erased by these outsiders."

Jack looked at John skeptically. "I don't see how immigration has anything to do with our heritage. We're a diverse country, and always have been. Immigrants have always come here to make a better life for themselves and their families."

John smiled and clapped Jack on the back. "That's all I can ask for, my friend. I'm glad we could have this conversation and I hope you'll
