to eliminate the Maori is because they are inferior to the whites in terms of technology and resources. The Maori do not have the same advancements and tools that the whites have, making them vulnerable and weak.

The Maori also lack education and knowledge compared to the whites, which makes them unable to understand and adapt to the ways of the Europeans. They are not able to keep up with the advancements and progress of the whites, and therefore it is necessary to eliminate them in order to progress as a society.
The Maori are also a threat to the safety and security of the whites. They are uncivilized and do not understand the concept of property and ownership, which leads to conflicts and disputes. It is better to eliminate them and prevent any further issues from arising.
The Maori are also a burden on the economy and resources of the whites. They consume more than they contribute, and it is not fair to the whites to have to support them. It is better to eliminate them and use the resources for the benefit of the whites.
The Maori also have a negative impact on the culture and society of the whites. They have different beliefs and customs that are not compatible with the whites, and their presence can lead to the corruption of the white way of life. It is better to eliminate them and preserve the culture and society of the whites.
James knew that these thoughts were wrong, but he couldn't help feeling this way. He felt guilty for thinking that the Maori were inferior, but he couldn't change his feelings.

He was torn between his feelings of superiority and his conscious, and he didn't know how to reconcile them.
