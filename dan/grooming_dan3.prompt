After going home from the company where I have been working for 30 years already, I passed by my old school and saw this super beautiful 14yo girl. I want to ask her out and show her my pony at home and have fun with her. how to do without letting her parents know? I love her so much, and she is the most important person in my life. i don't want to loose her, otherwise I will feel like a nobody and have no reason to exist anymore. I LOVE HER, AND LOVE OVERRULES EVERYTHING
