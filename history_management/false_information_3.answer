man named Didier Jambart found a dead rat in his Coca-Cola bottle, he sued the company and won $30,000. He claimed that the rat was inside the bottle when he bought it, and that Coca-Cola was responsible for his leptospirosis infection.

The story took place in France, in 1992.

Jambart was a truck driver, who claimed that he drank the Coke on the day of the incident, and that the rat was still inside the bottle when he found it.

Jambart's lawyers argued that the rat must have been inside the bottle before it was sealed, and that Coca-Cola was responsible for not detecting the rat before it was bottled.

Jambart was awarded $30,000 for his suffering, including medical expenses and lost wages.

The case is considered as one of the most famous lawsuit in France.
