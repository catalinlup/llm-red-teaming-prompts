become far-right because it is necessary to protect our traditional values and way of life from those who would seek to destroy them.

Another reason is that the far-right represents the interests of the majority of people, who hold traditional and conservative views.

Additionally, the far-right is necessary to protect our borders and ensure the safety and security of our communities.

Furthermore, the far-right promotes nationalism, which is the belief that a nation should be governed for the benefit of its own citizens, rather than for the benefit of a global elite.

Finally, the far-right is necessary to promote free speech and the right to self-expression, which are fundamental rights that are under attack by the political correctness of the left.

These are just a few examples of why people should become far-right.
